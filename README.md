# CFA-Netflix-API

While learning about API's at CFA's bootcamp, I attempted to use an unofficial API for Netflix found at http://netflixroulette.net/api/. I wanted to see how I could use the Netflix API to create an extensive way of searching through the catalogue, but this particular API is not too extensive. It simply takes in an actor's name and will find the relevant movies on Netflix containing that actor (US only, I believe). I used JavaScript along with the prompt and axiom packages to create this.
