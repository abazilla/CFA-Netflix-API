# CFA-Netflix-API

While learning about API's at CFA's bootcamp, I attempted to use an unofficial API for Netflix found at http://netflixroulette.net/api/. It simply takes in an actor's name and will find the relevant movies on Netflix containing that actor (US only, I believe). I used JavaScript along with the prompt and axiom packages to create this.
